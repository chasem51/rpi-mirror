# rpi-mirror
Magic Mirror 2 implementation of APIs/live widgets such as local weather, newsfeed, calendar, OpenGL rotating globe with mapped N/W/S/E coordinates, a live Spotify song "playing" view, & a short video display (gifs or such images), in my case, with Darwin's "Tree of Life"

Default app view scaffolding can be cloned by --> git clone https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror

To run, within the ~/MagicMirror directory, run -> npm start

My installation is run by the fork -> pm2 start MagicMirror
To allow for application's auto-boot with the pi.
